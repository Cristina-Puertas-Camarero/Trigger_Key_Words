# Trigger Key Words: Suicide Prevention through Text Analysis

## Project Description
Suicide is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide and an urgent public health issue. Many individuals at risk express warning signs through their words, whether in conversations, social media, or writings. However, these messages often go unnoticed, leaving those in need without the necessary intervention.

This project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** algorithms to identify key words associated with suicide risk in texts. The main objective is to contribute to **suicide prevention** by enabling early detection of these signals, facilitating a faster and more effective response. By combining data analysis, predictive modeling, and an interactive application, this project aims to generate value in academic research and potential practical applications.

### üåê Final Reflection and Next Steps

#### A Global Issue: Suicide Prevention
Suicide is a **multifactorial global issue** that affects millions of people each year. The analyzed data has revealed critical patterns, allowing us to better understand its causes and characteristics. However, suicide prevention requires **coordinated efforts** by public and private entities, combining educational, social, and technological approaches.

#### Key Development: A Machine Learning Model
One groundbreaking tool we have developed is a **Machine Learning model** designed to analyze text for warning signs. This model could become a valuable resource for identifying high-risk cases and enabling early intervention.

This section outlines the **Machine Learning process** for classifying texts as **suicidal** or **non-suicidal**. It involves three major steps:

- **Data Preparation**: Organizing and preprocessing text data for analysis.
- **Model Training**: Using algorithms to create predictive models.
- **Benchmark Evaluation**: Comparing model performance and selecting the final model.

These steps ensure a **robust and accurate classification process**, culminating in a model ready for deployment through the **Streamlit application**.
